# About

This is the sample application created by following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AekfR-EI-U&list=PLzZEuVaFb9Exi-pc8qtHBrrLg8bUn-TP6&index=1&pp=iAQB)

The code as almost completely the same, and there are a few things I don't really like:
1. Presentation
   - Missing view-model for the Onboarding Screen
   - The page should be the state upon which the UI should be created

2. Data
   - The `Context` variable in the LocalUserManagerImpl which is in the Data layer
